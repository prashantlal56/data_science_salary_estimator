# Data science Salary Estimator
Now a days the demand for data scientist have increased and many different companies are hiring Machine learning and Deep learning practitioner, giving different roles in their companies, assigning different titles and providing wide range salary

This is my small contribution towards data scientist community to understand different types of role assigned and the aspected salary being offered to them

## Project Overview

* Web scrapped the data from glassdoor.com
* Cleaned the dataset and extracted relevent columns
* Did exploratory data analysis to get the insight from data
* Feature engineered some of the columns
